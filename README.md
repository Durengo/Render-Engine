# Render-Engine
First attempt at making a rendering engine with OpenGL API.

Libraries:
  1. Dependencies: opengl, glew, debugbreak, glfw, glm, stb, imgui;
  2. Currently not used: imguizmo, spdlog, yaml-ccp;

CMakeLists.txt is set up to work right out of the box, but first, the necessary libraries must be acquired first. There is a script in utility/linux/build.sh to get all the libraries on linux (git is required).
